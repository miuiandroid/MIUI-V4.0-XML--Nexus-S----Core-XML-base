Welcome to MIUI notes!

     You can enter notes directly from the software or drag notes to the desktop using the widget. MIUI
     notes allows you to quickly create and save notes.

     In addition you can adjust background note colours, text size and organise notes by folders. Other
     functions allow you to create password protected notes, Google sync with task lists, export to SD card
     or keep call notes.
